### About Me

I am a passionate and driven Computer Science and Engineering student at St. Joseph's College of Engineering and Technology, with a strong foundation in software development, web technologies, and programming languages such as Java, Python, HTML, and JavaScript. My journey in tech has been enriched through hands-on projects like "Pawfect Match," a pet adoption platform developed during my internship at NeST Cyber Campus, which deepened my understanding of full-stack development and problem-solving in real-world scenarios.

I enjoy building creative and functional applications, especially using the MERN stack and modern tools like Vite, React, and GitHub for version control and deployment. I’ve also explored cybersecurity concepts like online privacy and database security, reflecting my curiosity across domains. My adaptability, attention to detail, and eagerness to learn make me well-suited for collaborative projects and fast-paced environments.

Whether it’s debugging code, designing intuitive UI, or learning about AI-powered tools for presentations and automation, I approach each task with enthusiasm and a growth mindset. I’m currently seeking opportunities to further sharpen my skills and contribute meaningfully to projects that make a difference.
